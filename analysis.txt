* Analysis of the problem
Some problems are present in Alpine Inc
  1. The manual build and deployment process depends on a single individual.
    - Pete, the lead developer, handles the entire build and deployment process.
    - When Pete quit, the company could not deploy important updates to its major customers.
  2. Production Issues:
    - Some cases where bugs are introduced into production affect the user experience. This means that the code was not thoroughly tested before deployment.
    - These errors increased the number of support calls from this customer, causing the support and development team to be overloaded with load management and troubleshooting.
  3. Affects psychology and revenue
    - Overtime has seriously caused the team's working morale to decline.
    - The missed release and many errors seriously affected Alpine Inc.'s revenue.
